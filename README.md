# HFT notes
## Trading Systems
### Does not require ultra-low latency

- It's important to note that even in trading systems that don't demand ultra-low latency, efficient and reliable execution remains important.
- Latency requirements may vary depending on the specific strategy, market conditions, and the desired trade execution speed.
1. Positional Trading Systems
    - Positional trading involves holding positions in securities for longer durations, ranging from days to months or even years.
    - These systems typically analyze fundamental factors, macroeconomic indicators, or technical patterns to identify investment opportunities.
    - Since the holding period is longer, the latency requirements are less stringent compared to high-frequency trading.

2. Swing Trading Systems
    - Swing trading strategies aim to capture short-to-medium-term price swings in the market.
    - These systems analyze technical indicators, chart patterns, and market trends to identify potential entry and exit points.
    - While swing trading may involve more frequent trades than positional trading, it operates on a longer time horizon, allowing for slightly higher latency tolerance.

3. Trend-Following Systems
    - Trend-following strategies aim to identify and capitalize on longer-term price trends in the market.
    - These systems use various indicators and trend analysis techniques to determine the direction and strength of a market trend.
    - The emphasis is on staying in the trade for an extended period, so ultra-low latency is not critical.

4. Fundamental Investing Systems
    - Fundamental investing strategies rely on analyzing a company's financials, industry trends, and other fundamental factors to make long-term investment decisions.
    - These systems often require comprehensive research and analysis rather than real-time market data, so low-latency requirements are not as important.

5. Options or Derivatives Trading Systems
    - Trading systems focused on options or other derivatives may not require ultra-low latency, as these markets often have longer expiration periods and less frequent trading.
    - Strategies involving options spreads, volatility trading, or hedging positions can operate with slightly higher latency requirements.

### Requies ultra-low latency

- In these trading systems, even small differences in latency can significantly impact profitability and competitiveness.
- Therefore, HFT firms invest heavily in low-latency technology infrastructure, including high-speed networks, proximity hosting, and optimized software algorithms, to minimize execution times and maintain an edge in the markets.
1. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Systems
    - HFT strategies involve executing a large number of trades within very short timeframes, often taking advantage of small price discrepancies or market inefficiencies that exist for only fractions of a second.
    - These systems rely on ultra-low latency to ensure rapid order placement, market data processing, and order execution to exploit fleeting opportunities.

2. Market Making Systems
    - Market making involves providing liquidity to the market by continuously placing bid and ask quotes for a particular security.
    - Market makers aim to profit from the bid-ask spread while minimizing the risk exposure.
    - Ultra-low latency is essential for market-making systems to swiftly adjust quotes in response to changing market conditions and to ensure fast order execution when interacting with incoming orders.

3. Arbitrage Trading Systems
    - Arbitrage strategies seek to profit from price discrepancies between different markets, exchanges, or instruments.
    - These price differences may exist for only short periods, requiring ultra-low latency to identify, analyze, and execute trades swiftly to exploit the arbitrage opportunity before it diminishes.

4. Scalping Systems
    - Scalping strategies aim to profit from small price fluctuations by entering and exiting trades rapidly.
    - These systems typically seek to capture very short-term market movements and require ultra-low latency to enter and exit positions quickly with minimal slippage.

5. News-Based Trading Systems
    - Some trading systems rely on news or event-driven strategies, where the speed of information processing is crucial.
    - These systems analyze news feeds, social media sentiment, or other data sources to identify market-moving events and execute trades based on the anticipated impact.
    - Ultra-low latency is essential to process and react to news events in real-time.

6. Statistical Arbitrage Systems
    - Statistical arbitrage strategies seek to identify and exploit statistical patterns or relationships between different securities or assets.
    - These systems often involve high-frequency trading and require ultra-low latency to capitalize on the short-lived opportunities identified by the statistical models.

## Commonly used algorithms

1. Market Making Algorithms
    - Market making algorithms are used to provide liquidity to the market by continuously quoting bid and ask prices for a particular security.
    - These algorithms dynamically adjust quotes based on market conditions, order book depth, and other factors to maintain a balanced position and profit from the bid-ask spread.

2. Statistical Arbitrage Algorithms
    - Statistical arbitrage algorithms aim to exploit pricing inefficiencies or relative mispricings between related securities based on statistical models.
    - These algorithms analyze historical relationships, correlations, or deviations between assets and generate trades to capture opportunities for price convergence or divergence.

3. Momentum Trading Algorithms
    - Momentum trading algorithms identify and capitalize on short-term price trends or momentum in the market.
    - These algorithms use technical indicators, market data analysis, and pattern recognition techniques to enter positions aligned with the prevailing trend and exit when the momentum weakens.

4. Pairs Trading Algorithms
    - Pairs trading algorithms involve trading a pair of related securities simultaneously, taking advantage of their relative price movements.
    - These algorithms monitor the price spread between the two securities and execute trades when the spread deviates from its historical mean, anticipating a reversion to the mean.

5. Liquidity Detection Algorithms
    - Liquidity detection algorithms aim to identify and interact with hidden or non-displayed liquidity in the market, such as dark pools or alternative trading venues.
    - These algorithms employ sophisticated order routing and execution techniques to access and execute trades in less visible liquidity sources.

6. Smart Order Routing (SOR) Algorithms
    - SOR algorithms optimize order routing decisions by dynamically analyzing market conditions, liquidity availability, and execution costs across multiple exchanges or trading venues.
    - These algorithms split orders, route them to the most favorable venues, and balance execution speed and price improvement to achieve best execution.

7. Execution Algorithms
    - Execution algorithms are designed to optimize the execution of large orders by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts and executing them over time. 
    - These algorithms consider factors like market impact, trading volumes, and order book dynamics to minimize slippage and achieve efficient execution.

8. Scalping Algorithms
    - Scalping algorithms focus on making a large number of small-profit trades by capturing small price differentials or spreads.
    - These algorithms aim to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations and typically employ high-frequency trading techniques to execute trades rapidly.

9. Volatility Trading Algorithms
    - Volatility trading algorithms aim to profit from changes in market volatility levels.
    - These algorithms employ options strategies, volatility derivatives, or dynamic hedging techniques to take positions based on anticipated volatility movements or shifts in implied volatility levels.

10. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Algorithms
    - HFT algorithms encompass a broad range of ultra-low latency algorithms that execute a large number of trades within extremely short timeframes.
    - These algorithms exploit small price discrepancies, market microstructure patterns, or latency arbitrage opportunities, relying on speed and technology to gain a competitive edge.
